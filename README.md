# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Up-and-coming playwright Louise Belcher intends to launch a Kickstarter to fund her play in the United States, *Fever*. She estimates a budget of over $10,000. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze other crowdfunding data, specifically within the United States and the theater industry. This analysis will determine factors that make for a successful crowdfunding campaign and help Louise Kickstart her own project successfully. 

## Analysis and Challenges
To begin the analysis, I gathered data from over 4,000 Kickstarter projects. The projects ranged in categories, locations, goals, launch dates, and outcomes. The data was represented in a variety of forms, including text, numerical, and unconverted UNIX dates. 

First, I needed to create some additional columns for subcategory of projects so we could compare Louise's goal of crowdfunding a play to other examples of play crowdfunding. It was important to convert the UNIX dates into a more recognizable format in order to analyze the impact of launch dates. There is a worksheet that looks at central tendancy and spread based on successful and failed projects, which informed the final analysis of outcomes based on goals.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
